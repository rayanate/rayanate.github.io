## General requirements:

I have successfully crafted a professional and visually appealing resume webpage using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. The page incorporates essential details such as my name, contact information, a professional headshot, and comprehensive sections highlighting my educational background and work experiences. The use of Bootstrap ensures a responsive and well-structured design, creating a seamless and polished presentation of my resume online.

## Non-technical requirements

I have added bootstrap cdn in the HTML page and used bootstrap classes to quickly style the elements on the page. This has helped me achieve a clean and professional design without having to write extensive CSS code. 

## Technical Requirements

### Basic Javascript code

I have used JQuery CDN in the HTML page to access the elements and performed the API calls for retrieving data from the server. This allows for dynamic updating of content without having to reload the entire page. 

I have included the functionalities from Lab2 i.e. analog clock, digital clock, show/hide email, Joke API
1. Joke API

2. Public API
   I have integrated Weather API to display weather and NASA API to display the image of the day.

3. Javascript Cookies
